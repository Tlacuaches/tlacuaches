# Tlacuaches Project

Welcome to the Tlacuaches project!

Yeah that's a real thing, the main idea of this project is help recent graduates to get up to date on cloud technologies, I think Mexico has a huge potential on this area and I'd like to contribute with something back.
I'll dedicate one hour per week during five/seven weeks or so to people who is ambicious enough to learn new stuff and accept new challenges, and probably create an startup or get hired.

I do not consider myself a guru on cloud technologies, but I have some experience, resources and friends that can be invited to join us for a session.

I'll provide 
- One hour of my precious life per week for a live session
- A virtual instance to work
- A hangout link
- Challenges
- Sysadmins, Devs, DevOps to join on some sessions and bright us
- Fun

There is no money involved here, and you just need to send me an email with your resume, and why you should be accepted on this project.
